# Contributing to the AI-Driven UHI Platform

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is essential for keeping this project great.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform/issues/new).

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This lets us coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:
* [**Good First Issues**](https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [**Help Wanted Issues**](https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.

### Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
5.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
6.  Open a Pull Request.

Please provide a clear description of your changes and why they are needed.

We look forward to your contributions!
