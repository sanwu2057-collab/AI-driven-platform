# AI-Driven Urban Heat Island Impact Platform

This platform predicts and monitors the impact of urban heat islands using NASAâ€™s Earth observation data, with a focus on health risks and sustainability for fast-growing cities.

## Features

- Ingest NASA Earth observation data for urban environments
- Predict urban heat island intensity and affected areas
- Assess health risks associated with heat islands
- Provide sustainability metrics and intervention recommendations
- Interactive visualization dashboard

## Directory Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend and data/model utilities
- `frontend/`: React frontend for visualization and dashboards
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and modeling

## Getting Started

1. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the backend API:
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    ```
3. Install frontend dependencies (`frontend/package.json`) and run the React app.
