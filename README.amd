# AI-Driven Urban Heat Island Impact Platform

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An open-source platform that leverages NASA Earth observation data to analyze, predict, and visualize the impact of Urban Heat Islands (UHI), focusing on public health risks and sustainability in growing cities.

---

## 🏙️ The Problem

Urban Heat Islands are metropolitan areas that are significantly warmer than their surrounding rural areas due to human activities. This phenomenon can lead to increased energy consumption, elevated emissions of air pollutants, and compromised human health and comfort, particularly during heatwaves. This platform aims to provide city planners, public health officials, and researchers with data-driven insights to mitigate these effects.

## ✨ Features

* **🛰️ NASA Data Ingestion**: Processes Earth observation data for urban environmental analysis.
* **🧠 Predictive Modeling**: Predicts UHI intensity and identifies high-risk areas.
* **🩺 Health Risk Assessment**: Analyzes the correlation between heat islands and public health metrics.
* **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly React-based interface for visualizing data and model outputs on an interactive map.
* **💡 Sustainability Insights**: Provides metrics and recommendations for urban planning and intervention.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js v14+ and npm
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform.git](https://github.com/sanwu2057-collab/AI-driven-platform.git)
    cd AI-driven-platform
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # (Optional) Create a .env file for your environment variables
    # cp .env.example .env

    # Run the server
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
